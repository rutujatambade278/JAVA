//	Abstraction is about showing only the necessary details to the user while hiding the complex implementation.
//    Example in Finance Module: In an online loan facility, users only need to know that they 
//	can apply for a loan. They donâ€™t need to see how the backend processes the application.
//    Interface: LoanService
//	Methods: applyLoan(), checkLoanStatus()
//	Here, the customer interacts with the LoanService interface.
//	The actual complex operations of applying and processing the loan are abstracted away from the user.
